# IVR_CW
Sorry that we didn't read the submission instruction carefully until we reach the end of the coursework pdf
We didn't keep our code on Github and commit until we finished everything.
So we have kept the code solutions to all questions so that you can check each. 

Please run image1.py, image2.py, image_processing.py to see 
results for Q2.1

Please run target_detect.py to see the result for Q2.2

Please run target_detect.py, closed_control.py to see the result for Q3.2

Please run target_detect.py, null_space_control.py to see the result for Q4.2

Note for control part as we are parsing the target position from cv, there will be some error at various point
please run it for some seconds to see the
overall tracking result.
